In the Steiner Multicycle Problem (SMCP), we are given a graph \(G = (V, E)\), and a collection of terminal sets \(\{T_1, \dots , T_k\}\), where for each \(a\) in \([k]\) we have a subset \(T_a\) of \(V\) and these terminal sets are pairwise disjoint. The problem consists in finding a set of vertex-disjoint cycles of minimum cost such that, for each \(a\) in \([k]\), all vertices of \(T_a\) belong to a same cycle. 
There exist applications related to routing problems that can be translated into instances of SMCP.
More precisely, the SMCP models a less-than-truckload scenario where multiple companies must periodically visit pickup and delivery locations.
To reduce their individuals costs, these companies can collaborate to create shared routes that visits multiple pickup and delivery locations in a way to reduce the total transportation costs.
Clearly, SMCP is a generalization of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP),  and thus does not admit a polynomial-time approximation scheme even in the metric case.
On the positive side, the literature for this problem describes a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) to Euclidean instances.
In this thesis, we generalize this result by showing a PTAS for SMCP on graphs of bounded genus.
The proposed algorithm is essentially an adaptation of the PTAS for the Steiner Forest Problem on graphs of bounded genus.
Furthermore, we implemented a 3-approximation algorithm for SMCP on complete metric graphs, and report on computational experiments using benchmark instances. 
The costs of the solutions produced by this algorithm  were on average \(34\%\) worse than the corresponding optimal solutions, which is considerably better than the theoretical guarantee. 
On the other hand, the running time of implementation is in general worse than the other heuristics presented in the literature.
