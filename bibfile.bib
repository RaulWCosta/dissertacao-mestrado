abstract = {Abstract For the past few decades, combinatorial optimization techniques have been shown to be powerful tools for formulating and solving optimization problems arising from practical situations. In particular, many network design problems have been formulated as combinatorial optimization problems. With the advances of optical technologies and the explosive growth of the Internet, telecommunication networks have seen an important evolution and therefore designing survivable networks has become a major objective for telecommunication operators. Over the past years, much research has been carried out to devise efficient methods for survivable network models, and particularly cutting plane based algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to survey some of these models and the optimization methods used for solving them. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 46(1), 1–21 2005},

abstract = { We present a general approximation technique for a large class of graph problems. Our technique mostly applies to problems of covering, at minimum cost, the vertices of a graph with trees, cycles, or paths satisfying certain requirements. In particular, many basic combinatorial optimization problems fit in this framework, including the shortest path, minimum-cost spanning tree, minimum-weight perfect matching, traveling salesman, and Steiner tree problems.Our technique produces approximation algorithms that run in \$O(n^{2} \log n)\$ time and come within a factor of 2 of optimal for most of these problems. For instance, we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm for the minimum-weight perfect matching problem under the triangle inequality. Our running time of \$O(n^{2} \log n)\$ time compares favorably with the best strongly polynomial exact algorithms running in \$O(n^{3})\$ time for dense graphs. A similar result is obtained for the 2-matching problem and its variants. We also derive the first approximation algorithms for many NP-complete problems, including the nonfixed point-to-point connection problem, the exact path partitioning problem, and complex location-design problems. Moreover, for the prize-collecting traveling salesman or Steiner tree problems, we obtain 2-approximation algorithms, therefore improving the previously best-known performance guarantees of 2.5 and 3, respectively [Math. Programming, 59 (1993), pp. 413–4201. }

 abstract = {Many problems from inventory, production and capacity planning, and from network design, exhibit scale economies and can be formulated in terms of finding minimum-additive-concave-cost nonnegative network flows. We reduce the problem to an equivalent one in which the arc flow costs are nonnegative and give a dynamic-programming method, called the send-and-split method, to solve it. The main work of the method entails repeatedly solving set-splitting and minimum-cost-chain problems. In uncapacitated networks with n nodes, a arcs, and d + 1 demand nodes, i.e., nodes with nonzero exogenous demand, the algorithm requires up to $n2^{-1}3^{d}+s2^{d}$ operations (additions and comparisons) where $s=n\ {\rm log}_{2}n+3a$ is the number of operations required to solve a minimum-cost-chain problem with nonnegative arc costs on the augmented graph formed by appending a node and an arc thereto from each node in the graph. If also the network is k-planar, i.e., the graph is planar with all demand nodes lying on the boundary of k faces, the method requires at most $n2^{-k}d^{3k}+sd^{2k}$ operations. The algorithm can be applied to capacitated networks because they can be reduced to equivalent uncapacitated ones. These results unify, significantly generalize (e.g., to cyclic problems), and sometimes improve upon (e.g., for tandem facilities) known polynomial-time dynamic-programming algorithms for Wagner and Whitin's (1958) dynamic economic-order-quantity problem, Zangwill's (1969) generalization to tandem facilities, and Veinott's (1969) increasing-capacity warehousing problem. The networks for the finite-period versions of these problems are each 1-planar. The method improves upon Zangwill's (1968) related $O(an^{d})$ running-time dynamic-programming method for finding minimum-additive-concave-cost nonnegative flows in circuitless single-source networks. We also implement the method to solve in polynomial time the (d + 1)-demand-node and k-planar versions of the minimum-cost forest and Steiner problems in graphs. The running time for the (d + 1)-demand-node Steiner problem in graphs is comparable to that of Dreyfus and Wagner's (1971) method.},

Our data structure allows edge insertion and deletion as well as the dual operations; these operations may implicitly change the genus of the embedding surface.

abstract = {Graph theory is a flourishing discipline containing a body of beautiful and powerful theorems of wide applicability. Its explosive growth in recent years is mainly due to its role as an essential structure underpinning modern applied mathematics computer science, combinatorial optimization, and operations research in particular but also to its increasing application in the more applied sciences. The versatility of graphs makes them indispensable tools in the design and analysis of communication networks, for instance. The primary aim of this book is to present a coherent introduction to the subject, suitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics and computer science. It provides a systematic treatment of the theory of graphs without sacrificing its intuitive and aesthetic appeal. Commonly used proof techniques are described and illustrated, and a wealth of exercises - of varying levels of difficulty - are provided to help the reader master the techniques and reinforce their grasp of the material. A second objective is to serve as an introduction to research in graph theory. To this end, sections on more advanced topics are included, and a number of interesting and challenging open problems are highlighted and discussed in some detail. Despite this more advanced material, the book has been organized in such a way that an introductory course on graph theory can be based on the first few sections of selected chapters.

abstract = {We prove that any graph excluding a fixed minor can have its edges partitioned into a desired number k of color classes such that contracting the edges in any one color class results in a graph of treewidth linear in k. This result is a natural finale to research in contraction decomposition, generalizing previous such decompositions for planar and bounded-genus graphs, and solving the main open problem in this area (posed at SODA 2007). Our decomposition can be computed in polynomial time, resulting in a general framework for approximation algorithms, particularly PTASs (with k ∼ 1/ε), and fixed-parameter algorithms, for problems closed under contractions in graphs excluding a fixed minor. For example, our approximation framework gives the first PTAS for TSP in weighted H-minor-free graphs, solving a decade-old open problem of Grohe; and gives another fixed-parameter algorithm for k-cut in H-minor-free graphs, which was an open problem of Downey et al. even for planar graphs.To obtain our contraction decompositions, we develop new graph structure theory to realize virtual edges in the clique-sum decomposition by actual paths in the graph, enabling the use of the powerful Robertson--Seymour Graph Minor decomposition theorem in the context of edge contractions (without edge deletions). This requires careful construction of paths to avoid blowup in the number of required paths beyond 3. Along the way, we strengthen and simplify contraction decompositions for bounded-genus graphs, so that the partition is determined by a simple radial ball growth independent of handles, starting from a set of vertices instead of just one, as long as this set is tight in a certain sense. We show that this tightness property holds for a constant number of approximately shortest paths in the surface, introducing several new concepts such as dives and rainbows.},

If a string is in the language, then there exists a proof such that the verifier accepts with probability 1 (i.e., for every choice of its random string). For strings not in the language, the verifier rejects every provided “proof” with probability at least 1/2. Our result builds upon and improves a recent result of Arora and Safra [1998] whose verifiers examine a nonconstant number of bits in the proof (though this number is a very slowly growing function of the input length).As a consequence, we prove that no MAX SNP-hard problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme, unless NP = P. The class MAX SNP was defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [1991] and hard problems for this class include vertex cover, maximum satisfiability, maximum cut, metric TSP, Steiner trees and shortest superstring. We also improve upon the clique hardness results of Feige et al. [1996] and Arora and Safra [1998] and show that there exists a positive ε such that approximating the maximum clique size in an N-vertex graph to within a factor of Nε is NP-hard.},

An instance consists of a network with link-costs and, for each pair \$\{i, j\}\$ of nodes, an edgeconnectivity requirement \$r\_{ij}\$. The goal is to find a minimum-cost network using the available links and satisfying the requirements. Our algorithm outputs a solution whose cost is within \$2 \lceil {\log\_{2}(r + 1)} \rceil \$ of optimal, where r is the highest requirement value. In the course of proving the performance guarantee, we prove a combinatorial minmax approximate equality relating minimum-cost networks to maximum packings of certain kinds of cuts. As a consequence of the proof of this theorem, we obtain an approximation algorithm for optimally packing these cuts; we show that this algorithm has application to estimating the reliability of a probabilistic network. }

The problem is a failure-resilient analog of the Steiner tree problem arising, for example, in telecommunications applications. We study a more general mixed-connectivity formulation, also employed in telecommunications optimization. Given a number (or requirement) r(v) ∈ {0, 1, 2} for each vertex v in the graph, find a minimum-cost subgraph in which there are min {r(u), r(v)} edge-disjoint u-to-v paths for every pair u, v of vertices.We address the problem in planar graphs, considering a popular relaxation in which the solution is allowed to use multiple copies of the input-graph edges (paying separately for each copy). The problem is max SNP-hard in general graphs and strongly NP-hard in planar graphs. We give the first polynomial-time approximation scheme in planar graphs. The running time is O(nlog n). Under the additional restriction that the requirements are only non-zero for vertices on the boundary of a single face of a planar graph, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal solution.},

The problem can be solved in time 2k ·nO(1) using the classical dynamic programming algorithms of Bellman and of Held and Karp, where k = |S| and n = |V(G)|. Our main resulvt is showing that the problem can be solved in time (2O(√k log k) + W) · nO(1) if G is a planar graph with weights that are integers no greater than W. While similar speedups have been observed for various paramterized problems on planar graphs, our result cannot be simply obtained as a consequence of bounding the treewidth of G or invoking bidimensionality theory. Our algorithm consists of two steps: (1) find a locally optimal solution, and (2) use it to guide a dynamic program. The proof of correctness of the algorithm depends on a treewidth bound on a graph obtained by combining an optimal solution with a locally optimal solution.},

This resolves a long standing open problem in a long line of work on designing PTASes for TSP in minor-closed families initiated by Grigni, Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou in FOCS'95. The main technical ingredient in our PTAS is a construction of a nearly light subset (1 + ϵ)-spanner for any given edge-weighted H-minor-free graph. This construction is based on a necessary and sufficient condition given by sparse spanner oracles: light subset spanners exist if and only if sparse spanner oracles exist. This relationship allows us to obtain two new results:• An (1 + ϵ)-spanner with lightness O(ϵ−d+2) for any doubling metric of constant dimension d. This improves the earlier lightness bound ϵ−O(d) obtained by Borradaile, Le and Wulff-Nilsen [14].• An (1 + ϵ)-spanner with sublinear lightness for any metric of constant correlation dimension. Previously no spanner with non-trivial lightness was known.},

abstract = {We give an efficient algorithm for maintaining a minimum spanning forest of a plane graph subject to on-line modifications. The modifications supported include changes in the edge weights and insertion and deletion of edges and vertices which are consistent with the given embedding. To implement the algorithms, we develop a data structure called an edge-ordered dynamic tree, which is a variant of the dynamic tree data structure of Sleator and Tarjan. Using this data structure, our algorithm runs in O(log n) time per operation and O(n) space. The algorithm can be used to maintain the connected components of a dynamic planar graph in O(logn) time per operation. We also show that any algorithm will need Ω(log n) amortized time per operation, given a set of machine operations that is fairly general.}
