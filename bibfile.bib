abstract = { We present a general approximation technique for a large class of graph problems. Our technique mostly applies to problems of covering, at minimum cost, the vertices of a graph with trees, cycles, or paths satisfying certain requirements. In particular, many basic combinatorial optimization problems fit in this framework, including the shortest path, minimum-cost spanning tree, minimum-weight perfect matching, traveling salesman, and Steiner tree problems.Our technique produces approximation algorithms that run in \$O(n^{2} \log n)\$ time and come within a factor of 2 of optimal for most of these problems. For instance, we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm for the minimum-weight perfect matching problem under the triangle inequality. Our running time of \$O(n^{2} \log n)\$ time compares favorably with the best strongly polynomial exact algorithms running in \$O(n^{3})\$ time for dense graphs. A similar result is obtained for the 2-matching problem and its variants. We also derive the first approximation algorithms for many NP-complete problems, including the nonfixed point-to-point connection problem, the exact path partitioning problem, and complex location-design problems. Moreover, for the prize-collecting traveling salesman or Steiner tree problems, we obtain 2-approximation algorithms, therefore improving the previously best-known performance guarantees of 2.5 and 3, respectively [Math. Programming, 59 (1993), pp. 413–4201. }

 abstract = {Many problems from inventory, production and capacity planning, and from network design, exhibit scale economies and can be formulated in terms of finding minimum-additive-concave-cost nonnegative network flows. We reduce the problem to an equivalent one in which the arc flow costs are nonnegative and give a dynamic-programming method, called the send-and-split method, to solve it. The main work of the method entails repeatedly solving set-splitting and minimum-cost-chain problems. In uncapacitated networks with n nodes, a arcs, and d + 1 demand nodes, i.e., nodes with nonzero exogenous demand, the algorithm requires up to $n2^{-1}3^{d}+s2^{d}$ operations (additions and comparisons) where $s=n\ {\rm log}_{2}n+3a$ is the number of operations required to solve a minimum-cost-chain problem with nonnegative arc costs on the augmented graph formed by appending a node and an arc thereto from each node in the graph. If also the network is k-planar, i.e., the graph is planar with all demand nodes lying on the boundary of k faces, the method requires at most $n2^{-k}d^{3k}+sd^{2k}$ operations. The algorithm can be applied to capacitated networks because they can be reduced to equivalent uncapacitated ones. These results unify, significantly generalize (e.g., to cyclic problems), and sometimes improve upon (e.g., for tandem facilities) known polynomial-time dynamic-programming algorithms for Wagner and Whitin's (1958) dynamic economic-order-quantity problem, Zangwill's (1969) generalization to tandem facilities, and Veinott's (1969) increasing-capacity warehousing problem. The networks for the finite-period versions of these problems are each 1-planar. The method improves upon Zangwill's (1968) related $O(an^{d})$ running-time dynamic-programming method for finding minimum-additive-concave-cost nonnegative flows in circuitless single-source networks. We also implement the method to solve in polynomial time the (d + 1)-demand-node and k-planar versions of the minimum-cost forest and Steiner problems in graphs. The running time for the (d + 1)-demand-node Steiner problem in graphs is comparable to that of Dreyfus and Wagner's (1971) method.},

abstract = {Graph theory is a flourishing discipline containing a body of beautiful and powerful theorems of wide applicability. Its explosive growth in recent years is mainly due to its role as an essential structure underpinning modern applied mathematics computer science, combinatorial optimization, and operations research in particular but also to its increasing application in the more applied sciences. The versatility of graphs makes them indispensable tools in the design and analysis of communication networks, for instance. The primary aim of this book is to present a coherent introduction to the subject, suitable as a textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics and computer science. It provides a systematic treatment of the theory of graphs without sacrificing its intuitive and aesthetic appeal. Commonly used proof techniques are described and illustrated, and a wealth of exercises - of varying levels of difficulty - are provided to help the reader master the techniques and reinforce their grasp of the material. A second objective is to serve as an introduction to research in graph theory. To this end, sections on more advanced topics are included, and a number of interesting and challenging open problems are highlighted and discussed in some detail. Despite this more advanced material, the book has been organized in such a way that an introductory course on graph theory can be based on the first few sections of selected chapters.
