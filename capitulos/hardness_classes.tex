\chapter{Hardness Study for Steiner Multicycle Problem}
\label{chapter:hardness}

This chapter will provide some analysis of the difficulty class of the Steiner Multicycle Problem in different classes of graphs.

We begin by a reduction of the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem to the SMCP. The Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (\(HCP\)) is known to still be hard on planar graphs, so by making a reduction from the \(HPC\) to the \(SMCP\) in this class of graphs, we prove that the SMCP is also hard on planar graphs.
