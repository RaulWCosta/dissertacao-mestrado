In the Steiner Multicycle Problem (SMCP), we are given a graph G = (V, E), and a collection {T_1,..., T_k} of k pairwise disjoint subsets of V. The problem consists in finding a set of vertex-disjoint cycles of minimum cost such that, for each i in [k], all vertices of T_i belong to a same cycle. SMCP models a less-than-truckload scenario where multiple companies must periodically visit pickup and delivery locations. To reduce their individuals costs, companies can collaborate to create shared routes that visit multiple pickup and delivery locations in a way to reduce the total transportation costs. Firts we show a PTAS for SMCP on graphs of bounded genus. Furthermore, we implemented a 3-approximation algorithm for SMCP on complete metric graphs, and report on computational experiments using benchmark instances.The costs of the solutions produced were on average 34% worse than the optimal solutions, which is considerably better than the theoretical guarantee.
